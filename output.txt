My text to read

Text from file.txt:
How the snow will come down from the mountains in streams,
Oh, deep, in the spring.
You will dream of a blue-eyed flower,
Away from me, away...
But autumn did not cover that trail with leaves,
Because I will return to you in the spring, dear...
I will take your hands in mine again,
The yellow flower of separation will not bloom between us!
